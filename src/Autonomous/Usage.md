# Usage

Take a look at one of the sections to find what you're looking for. If you can't find something that needs to be documented, [complain here](https://github.com/Sooner-Rover-Team/soro-documentation/issues) until someone does something.

## Sections

### [Software](Software/README.md)

The software section documents how (and when) to use *software*. Preferably, it should also link to automatic documentation like `rustdoc`.

### [Hardware](Hardware/README.md)

In the *hardware* section, you'll find documentation related to hardware components from the autonomous side of things.

There could be duplicates in other subteam sections, but they may be tailored to different needs.

### [Guides](Guides/README.md)

Here, you'll find general *guides* about how to do useful things. They don't have to be related to your projects - just something that's helpful to share.
