# Hardware

Autonomous hardware often has to do with making the Rover do new things! For example, by using special cameras that reflect human vision, we can more accurately determine location and navigate the world!

Documenting new hardware is easy! Just do the following:

1. Research something you want!
2. [Make a new page](../../new-page-guide.md)!
3. Go ahead and fill in some reasons why you want to use this! Give some information about the device and some links to resources about it.
4. If it [links to ROS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robot_Operating_System), tell Tyler so he can be excited
