# ZED 2i Camera 

The ZED 2i is a camera designed to repilicate human sight. It does this through the usage of 2 seperate cameras attached to the same module. Having 2 cameras allows the Zed 2i to have strong depth perception capabilities on top of its already powereful AI tools.

Here are some of the ways we can interface with the camera in different languages coming directly from the Zed 2i docs found here: [Zed 2i Docs](https://www.stereolabs.com/docs/get-started-with-zed/)

## Python Usage: 

The developers of the camera have provided offical docs for python, as well as example programs such [Python Example](https://github.com/stereolabs/zed-opencv/blob/master/python/zed-opencv.py)

Some libaries of note are:

### ZED SDK:[Zed SDK homepage](https://www.stereolabs.com/developers/release/) 
### OpenCV:[OpenCV Homepage](https://opencv.org/)

## C++ Usage: 

The developers of the camera have also provided offical docs for C++, however the libaries are the same.
